Add a "Pin It" button over your images, so users can add it to Pinterest easily.

== Description ==

Don't like the "Pin It" button underneath your post? Want to be able to add images directly to Pinterest by just clicking on the image? Your problems are over!

Have the user just hover the mouse over the image they want to pin and watch your visits grow!

The description goes automatically as the name of the post, and so does the link of the post.

Just enable the plugin. No need for any configuration!

The main feature I want to release in a future version is the ability to control where the buttons will show. But I'll take other suggestions if you have any. Just leave your ideas in the plugin forum.

= Known bugs: =

If the image isn't aligned to the left (i.e. centered ou right-aligned) the button will present itself with a problem. I'm still working on it, so please be patient. Any ideas regarding this will be well recieved - so please post your solution to the forum.
