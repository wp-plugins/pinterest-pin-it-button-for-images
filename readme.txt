Add a "Pin It" over your images, so users can add it to Pinterest easily.

== Description ==

	Don't like the "Pin It" button underneath your post? Want to be able to add images directly to Pinterest? This is your solution! The user just has to hover the mouse over the image to see the "Pin It" button and click on it!

	The description goes automatically as the name of the post, and so does the link of the post.

	Just enable the plugin. No need for any configuration!
