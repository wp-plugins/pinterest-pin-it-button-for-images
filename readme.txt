Add a "Pin It" button over your images, so users can add it to Pinterest easily.

== Description ==

Don't like the "Pin It" button underneath your post? Want to be able to add images directly to Pinterest by just clicking on the image? Your problems are over!

Have the user just hover the mouse over the image they want to pin and watch your visits grow!

The description goes automatically as the name of the post, and so does the link of the post.

Just enable the plugin. The optimal configurations are set, but if you wish, we have a little panel under "Settings > Pinterest Pin It"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any know bugs? =

Yes. Websites with many images per post or floating may present problems. If you have the "smileys" activated, those also may present problems. Opt-out only works on single and pages, not on index. Button can't be changed (yet!)

= Are you going to solve these bugs? =
Yes. I am constantly trying to make the plugin better, but as it's a free plugin I don't get much time to work on it. Please consider donating any spare change to help me work on this plugin more. Donations can be made at: http://desgn.me/pinterest

= Where do I report bugs? =
In the WordPress forum (http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/pinterest-pin-it-button-for-images) or, even better (as I check it more often), our bug tracker at http://canha.net/bugs/ 

== Screenshots ==

1. Button that shows on image hover
2. New settings panel
