Add a "Pin It" button over your images, so users can add it to Pinterest easily.

== Description ==

Don't like the "Pin It" button underneath your post? Want to be able to add images directly to Pinterest by just clicking on the image? Your problems are over!

Have the user just hover the mouse over the image they want to pin and watch your visits grow!

The description goes automatically as the name of the post, and so does the link of the post.

Just enable the plugin. No need for any configuration!
